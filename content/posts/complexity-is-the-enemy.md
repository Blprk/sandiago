Modern web development has lost its way. We trade megabytes of JavaScript for developer convenience. We accept 3-second load times as "normal." We build Rube Goldberg machines to render text.

It stops now.

## The Cost of Abstraction

Every layer of abstraction is a tax. 
- React adds a tax.
- Tailwind adds a tax.
- NPM dependencies add a compounding tax.

The user pays this tax in battery life, data usage, and patience.

## The Solution

**Delete code.**

The fastest code is the code you never write. The most secure dependency is the one you don't install. 

Build with primitives. HTML is a rendering engine. CSS is a styling language. The browser is the framework. 

Return to the metal.
